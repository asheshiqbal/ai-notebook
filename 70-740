***BGInfo - Paste a shortcut to a batch file in the Common Startup folder (shell:common startup)
		Directory:\..\Bginfo64.exe "config-file".bgi /silent /nolicprompt /timer:0

*** fsutil - can be used to create dummy files

*** Powershell Direct - uses -VMName instead of -ComputerName, can bypass network layer and connect through the bus layer of a vm during a remote session

*** Tools for mass deployment of OS and updates:
	1. Windows Deployment Services (WDS)
	2. System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)
	3. Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)

*** Shutdown/Logoff/Restart:
	shutdown /s /t 0 - Shutting down
	shutdown /l /t 0 - Logging out
	shutdown /r /t 0 - Restarting

*** netsh - Configure network i.e.
		netsh interface ipv4 set address name="?" static A.A.A.A M.M.M.M G.G.G.G
		netsh interface ipv4 set dns name="?" static D.D.D.D [index=2]
		netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

*** sconfig - basic server configuration in Core Edition

*** Get-Command - Use in powershell with wildcard and noun to list available cmdlets i.e. Get-Command *net*
*** Update-Help - Use in powershell to update help.
*** Get-Help - Use in powershell to view help for a particular cmdlet.

*** Administrative Share: \\host\c$

*** Enter-PSSession vs Invoke-Command
	Both uses http for remote management
	Invoke-Command -ComputerName  -ScriptBlock {} : this allows targeting multiple machine at once

*** Desired State Configuration (DSC) - powershell code script, to avoid configuration drift, idempotent
	Managed Object Framework (MOF) File - deliverable via Start-DscConfiguration
	Local Confihuration Manager (LCM) - Modes: ApplyOnly/ApplyAndMonitor/ApplyAndAutoCorrect

*** Activation - Retail License/OEM License/Volume License
	Volume Activation Services
	to check license status: slmgr /dlv
	Activation Models:
	Multiple Access Keys (MAK) - suitable for <50 machines, may use Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT)
	Key Management Service (KMS) - suitable for >50 machines, uses VAMT to manage Customer Specific Volume License Key (CSVLK), the clients are given public Generic Volume License Keys (GVLK) through Active Directory DNS
	Active-Directory-Based Activation (ADBA) - CSVLK is an AD object in the DC, domain members contain GVLK
	Automatic Virtual Machine Activation (AVMA) - a properly activated Hyper-V host will automatically activate all guests containg public AVMA keys 

*** Version Upgradation
	In-place Upgrade - overwriting (auto migration occurs from Windows.OLD and the new Windows folder), has many restrictions
	Clean Installation+Migration - Windows Server Migration Tools (includes smigdeploy and powershell cmdlets)

*** Nano Server - completely remotely managed, local logon available into recovery console only
	Joining domain is done by harvesting blob from an already joined machine
	Uses Powershell Core which can be accessed via Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
	Roles and Features are Packages
	Supports DSC, no support for Group Policy
	Supports only 64 bit
	NanoServerImageGenerator - powershell module containing cmdlets to create Nano server image/vm
	NanoServerImageBuilder - graphical tool to create Nano server image/vm

*** Virtualization
	Microsoft Assessment & Planning (MAP) Toolkit - uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to query machines in an environment
	Hyper-V uses Linux Integration Services (LIS) & FreeBSD Integration Services (BIS) drivers to support Linux machines

*** Images
	Deployment Image Servicing & Management (DISM) Utility can work on WIM files or VHD/X

*** Disks
	Disk ---partition---> Volume
	Sector Size - fixed by manufacturer
	Cluster Size/Allocation Unit Size (AUS) - configurable during formatting, should be chosen according to workload
	Partition Style:
		Master Boot Record (MBR) - works on BIOS firmware, stores partition table in boot sector only
		GUID Partition Table (GPT) - works on UEFI firmware, stores copy of partition table in all partitions
	File System:
		New Technology File System (NTFS) - bootable and supports  disk quota, file-level encryption or removable media
		Resilient File System (ReFS) - works based on metadata stored in B-Tree, has inherent integrity checking and cloning feature, is not bootable, does not support disk quota, file-level encryption or removable media

*** Virtual Disks - has the benefit of thin provisiioning and portability
	Fixed Provisioning - Allocate ahead of time
	Thin Provisioning - Allocate dynamically

*** Share - underlying protocol is SMB/NFS
	Server Message Block (SMB) - supports Windows clients
	Network File System (NFS) - supports Linux clients
	File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) - allows advanced configuration
	Hidden Share - created by appending $ to share name, can be accessed through UNC Path name
	Access Based Enumeration - views only resources that the viewer has permission to atleast read
	
*** Permission - DENY always overrides ALLOW
	Share Permission - applied when browsing through a network share
	Folder/NTFS Permission - applied when accessing the shared directory locally
	Resource
	Principal
	Inheritence
	Effective Access - Combination of all permission a user is finally granted from all sources i.e. special ACL, inheritence, group membership
	
*** Storage
	Locally Attached Storage
	Direct Attached Storage
	Network Attached Storage
	Just a Bunch of Disks (JBOD)
	Interfaces: USB, SATA, SCSI, iSCSI, SAS
	Tiers: SSD, HDD

*** Storage Spaces - storage virtualization
	Physical Disks <> Storage Pool <> Storage Space <> Virtual Disks <> Volumes
	Resiliency Steeings: Simple - RAID 0, Mirror - RAID 1, Parity - RAID 5
	Storage Spaces Direct: ?
	Logical Unit Number (LUN): ?

*** Advanced Storage Features:
	Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) - allows access to SAN/NAS using SCSI commands over IP network without needing Fiber Channel, the storage is the iSCSI Target and the client is the iSCSI Initiator 
	Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) - simplifies deployment for enterprise level iSCSI by acting as DNS
	Data Center Bridging (DCB) - allows SAN and LAN traffic to coexist by prioritizing policy
	Multi Protocol I/O (MPIO) - provides redundancy at physical connection level to storage 

*** Storage Replica - suitable for disaster recovery, works in block level, superior to Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) in older versions of Windows Server which works in file level
	Replication Partnership Scenarios:
		Server to Server - manual failover
		Cluster to Cluster - manual failover
		Stretch Cluster - automatic failover inside/across sites
		Server to Self

*** Data Deduplication - saves storage by storeing chunks of duplicate data in a chunk store and places a pointer called reparse point in the original location

*** Hyper-V
	System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)
	Generation 1 - uses standard driver to emulate hardware
	Generation 2 - uses synthetic driver, software based, no emulation layer
	Non Unifom Memory Access (NUMA) Spanning
	Smart Paging
	Resource Metering
	Direct Device Assignment (DDA) - PCI
	Shared Virtual Drive - used in the context of guest failover cluster
	VHD Set
	Pass-through Disks - a VM can have exclusive access to a disk attached to the host
	Quality of Service (QoS) - specifies minimum/maximum IOPS that a virtual disk can consume from the disk that it lives on 
	Differencing Disks - parent-child relationship
	Production Checkpoint - backups the complete data along with application
	Fiber Channel Adapter - connects the VM to the SAN through a virtual SAN on the host
	Single Root I/O Virtualization (SRIOV) - connects VM directly to the host's physical NIC bypassing virtual switch
	NIC Teaming - two or more NICs are teamed as one, provides hardware-independent bandwidth aggregation, load balancing, fault tolerance, failover
	Switch Embeded Teaming (SET)
	Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) - allows NIC to communicate directly with application memory bypassing OS buffer

*** Container
