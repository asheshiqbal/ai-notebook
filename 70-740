*** Virtual Disks - has the benefit of thin provisiioning and portability
	Fixed Provisioning - Allocate ahead of time
	Thin Provisioning - Allocate dynamically

*** Share - underlying protocol is SMB/NFS
	Server Message Block (SMB) - supports Windows clients
	Network File System (NFS) - supports Linux clients
	File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) - allows advanced configuration
	Hidden Share - created by appending $ to share name, can be accessed through UNC Path name
	Access Based Enumeration - views only resources that the viewer has permission to atleast read
	
*** Permission - DENY always overrides ALLOW
	Share Permission - applied when browsing through a network share
	Folder/NTFS Permission - applied when accessing the shared directory locally
	Resource
	Principal
	Inheritence
	Effective Access - Combination of all permission a user is finally granted from all sources i.e. special ACL, inheritence, group membership

*** Storage Replica - suitable for disaster recovery, works in block level, superior to Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) in older versions of Windows Server which works in file level
	Replication Partnership Scenarios:
		Server to Server - manual failover
		Cluster to Cluster - manual failover
		Stretch Cluster - automatic failover inside/across sites
		Server to Self
