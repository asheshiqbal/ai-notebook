	Active-Directory-Based Activation (ADBA) - CSVLK is an AD object in the DC, domain members contain GVLK
	Automatic Virtual Machine Activation (AVMA) - a properly activated Hyper-V host will automatically activate all guests containg public AVMA keys

	Partition Style:
		Master Boot Record (MBR) - works on BIOS firmware, stores partition table in boot sector only
		GUID Partition Table (GPT) - works on UEFI firmware, stores copy of partition table in all partitions
	File System:
		New Technology File System (NTFS) - bootable and supports  disk quota, file-level encryption or removable media
		Resilient File System (ReFS) - works based on metadata stored in B-Tree, has inherent integrity checking and cloning feature, is not bootable, does not support disk quota, file-level encryption or removable media

*** Virtual Disks - has the benefit of thin provisiioning and portability
	Fixed Provisioning - Allocate ahead of time
	Thin Provisioning - Allocate dynamically

*** Share - underlying protocol is SMB/NFS
	Server Message Block (SMB) - supports Windows clients
	Network File System (NFS) - supports Linux clients
	File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) - allows advanced configuration
	Hidden Share - created by appending $ to share name, can be accessed through UNC Path name
	Access Based Enumeration - views only resources that the viewer has permission to atleast read
	
*** Permission - DENY always overrides ALLOW
	Share Permission - applied when browsing through a network share
	Folder/NTFS Permission - applied when accessing the shared directory locally
	Resource
	Principal
	Inheritence
	Effective Access - Combination of all permission a user is finally granted from all sources i.e. special ACL, inheritence, group membership
	
*** Storage
	Locally Attached Storage
	Direct Attached Storage
	Network Attached Storage

	Data Center Bridging (DCB) - allows SAN and LAN traffic to coexist by prioritizing policy
	Multi Protocol I/O (MPIO) - provides redundancy at physical connection level to storage 

*** Storage Replica - suitable for disaster recovery, works in block level, superior to Distributed File System Replication (DFSR) in older versions of Windows Server which works in file level
	Replication Partnership Scenarios:
		Server to Server - manual failover
		Cluster to Cluster - manual failover
		Stretch Cluster - automatic failover inside/across sites
		Server to Self

*** Data Deduplication - saves storage by storing chunks of duplicate data in a chunk store and places a pointer called reparse point in the original location

	Switch Embeded Teaming (SET)
	Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) - allows NIC to communicate directly with application memory bypassing OS buffer

*** Container - OS virtualization
	Windows Container - container kernel is shared among the containers

	Shared Nothing Live Migration - moves both VM running state and local storage
	Storage Migration
	CredSSP authentication protocol - does not support double hops

	Microsoft Virtual System Migration Service

*** Failover Cluster - high availability feature, eliminates single point of failure
	Cluster Types:
		Single Domain Cluster - relies on AD
		Multi Domain Cluster - relies on DNS
		Workgroup Cluster - relies on DNS
